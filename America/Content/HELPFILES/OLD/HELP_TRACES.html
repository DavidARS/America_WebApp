River flows have long historical records. A "trace" is a section of the historical record for river flow. In these simulations, we use a 30-year trace for the model. If the simulation runs longer than 30 years, the trace is repeated. 
<br><br>
The trace chosen will determine if the model builds around low flow years, median flow years, high flow years, or years of high inter-annual variabilityâ€”with some low flow and some high flow years.

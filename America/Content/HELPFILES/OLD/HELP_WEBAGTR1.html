<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
<b>Definition:</b>The percentage of agriculture water credits being diverted from agricultural use on farms to municipal water use for the region as a whole. <br><br>

<b>Real World Example:</b> 
Presently, agriculture accounts for almost 50% of the total water used in Maricopa County. This includes small farmers and ranchers as well as large companies that raise animals or grow crops. In the future, water currently used for farming and agriculture may instead be used to help meet the water needs of growing communities.
<br><br>

<b>Implementation:</b> 
This control determines the percentage, from 0 to 100%, of surface and groundwater diverted from farms and agriculture to municipal water use, i.e., household water use, commercial uses, and industry, with 100% representing all available water being diverted and no water available for agriculture. However, the transfer of water credits would be phased in gradually and complete transfer would not be completed until 2085. Thus, the default value of 31% for 2085 appears as 10% for the 2050 value in the Agriculture Sustainability Indicator.
<br><br>
NOTE: Not all water providers have agriculture. Cities vary in the water used for agriculture, and thus their ability to transfer water to municipal use.

<b>Reclaimed Water Management </b> increases the amount of reclaimed ("recycled") effluent from the Waste Water Treatment Plant that can be treated for use. These are pre-set values, with the controls ranging from "None" (or no change in surface water supplies) to "High" which represents an increase of water reclaimed, representing 20% of the total water demand (with more water demand comes more water available to be reclaimed).
